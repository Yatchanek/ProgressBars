Simple progress bars with easy customization. You can change the number and size of individual bars, their separation, corner radius, shrink mode etc. They automatically set their color on the red-green spectrum.
The value provided must be within the 0-100 range in order to display properly. I've attached a simple test scene. Please feel free to experiment and enhance.
